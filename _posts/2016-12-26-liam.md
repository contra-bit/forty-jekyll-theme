#### idle minds
fix upon each other <br/> trace each other and follow, sniffing each other's arse <br/> like a midnight binge <br/> emptying the fridge <br/> all the remains on the kitchen floor.

the bored animals. the stupid dogs. <br/> begging for food at the dinner table. <br/> that helpless look in their eyes.

full up for 30 seconds. <br/> licking the bones like the fucking dumb creatures they are. <br/> soon emptiness creeps back <br/> and idle eyes go searchin for scraps.
