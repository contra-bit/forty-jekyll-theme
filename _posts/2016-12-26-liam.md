idle minds
fix upon each other
trace each other and follow, sniffing each other's arse
like a midnight binge
emptying the fridge
all the remains on the kitchen floor.

the bored animals. the stupid dogs.
begging for food at the dinner table.
that helpless look in their eyes.

full up for 30 seconds.
licking the bones like the fucking dumb creatures they are.
soon emptiness creeps back
and idle eyes go searchin for scraps.
