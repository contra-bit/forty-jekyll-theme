# Poems
## by Liam
Over time Liam has written a few poems which reflect his personal self at the time of writting

## Curated list of art
### one of god's cruel jokes:
damaged fruit, <br /> rotten to the core, <br /> i stay out of the way <br /> out of your way, <br /> till the storm has passed.

outside is a beautiful blue day <br /> inside there is a war going on.

we are some of god's cruel jokes. <br /> he was having a laugh. <br /> he was putting us on. <br />we are <br />some of god's cruel jokes

### idle minds
idle minds<br />fix upon each other<br />trace each other and follow, sniffing each other's arse<br />like a midnight binge<br />emptying the fridge<br />all the remains on the kitchen floor.

the bored animals. the stupid dogs.<br />begging for food at the dinner table.<br />that helpless look in their eyes.

full up for 30 seconds.<br />licking the bones like the fucking dumb creatures they are.<br />soon emptiness creeps back<br />and idle eyes go searchin for scraps
